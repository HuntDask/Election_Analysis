## Deliverable 3: Written Analysis of the Election Audit 

### Overview of Election Audit
For this project in Python, we are asked to help Seth and Tom submit election audit results to the electin commission by finding additonal data to complete the research and election results collection. To do this, we imported election results files and wrote out our python code in our challenge file to examine the voter turnout per county, percetnage of votes from each county and total count, and which county won with the highest turnout. 

### Election-Audit Results:

- How many votes were cast in this congressional election?

the amount of votes in the election totaled to 369,711

- Breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of total votes for each county in the precinct.

Jefferson county: 10.5% with a total vote count of 38,855

Denver county: 82.8% with a total vote count of 306,055

Arapahoe county: 6.7% with a total vote count of 24,801

- Which county had the largest number of votes?

Denver came out on top in the election with 306,055 votes, 82.8% of the total voter count.

- Breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of the total votes each candidate received.

Charles Casper Stockham: 23% of total votes with a count of 85,213

Diana DeGette: 73.8% of total votes with a count of 272,892

Raymon Anthony Doane: 3.1% of total votes with a count of 11,606

- Which canddiate won the election, what was their vote count, and what was their percentage of the total votes?

Diana DeGette won the election with 73.8% total votes with a count of 272,892

### Election-Audit Summary:

For the election commission, I would use this script created through Python to determine the election resluts for the county, but more importantly for future elections. This written code can be used for elections to come if we are ableto just import different election vote counts and we can use this importatant data code for future countings. It could ptoentially be modified to do counts for any voting count, inlduing country elections, school administration votings, or any example of data analysis when it comes to counting and determining voting results.
